The offensive & defensive players have stamina

The best moves both on defense & on offsense require the most stamina, but if there is a bonus given

A fast player on offense can drive while the defensive player wont be able to react in time which
will make his defensive impact lasser on the offensive player, in extreme cases the defense will be nagated
entirely and off ball defense will be required to contain extremely fast players
