# Jam Quest - Action Turn-Based Basketball Game

**Jam Quest** is an action turn-based basketball game with pixel art, developed in Godot. This guide will help you set up the game on your Windows computer and configure Visual Studio Code (VS Code) for development.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, you will need the following installed:

- [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/download) (Version used: **X.X.X**)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## Clone the Repository

1. First, clone this repository to your local machine by running the following command in your terminal or Git Bash:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project folder:

    ```bash
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

## Setting up the Project in Godot

1. Open **Godot Engine**.

2. In Godot, click **"Import"** on the project manager screen.

3. Select the `project.godot` file in the cloned project folder.

4. Click **"Open"** to load the project.

## Running the Project

1. Once the project is open in Godot, click the **"Play"** button (the green triangle) to run the project.

## Setting up Visual Studio Code

To enhance your development experience with Visual Studio Code, follow these steps:

### 1. Install Godot VS Code Plugin

Install the **Godot Tools** extension for VS Code to enable better integration with Godot. This extension adds syntax highlighting, code completion, debugging support, and more.

- Go to the [Godot Tools extension page](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=justdan01.godot-tools).
- Click **Install** to add it to VS Code.

### 2. Open the Project in VS Code

1. Launch **Visual Studio Code**.
2. Open the project folder by clicking **File > Open Folder** and selecting the cloned project folder.
3. If you are using **GDScript**, VS Code should automatically detect it and provide you with syntax highlighting.

### 3. Code Formatting (Optional)

If you want to automatically format your code, you can install **Prettier** or use Godotâ€™s built-in formatting options. This step is optional but recommended for a cleaner codebase.

## Building the Project for Windows

If you'd like to export the game for Windows, follow these steps:

1. In Godot, go to **Project > Export**.
2. Choose **Windows Desktop** as the target platform.
3. Click **"Export Project"** and select a location to save the `.exe` file.
4. Share the `.exe` and accompanying files with your friends!

## Troubleshooting

- **Missing DLLs**: If you get an error about missing DLLs, make sure you have the necessary Visual C++ Redistributable packages installed. You can download them from [here](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads).
  
- **Missing Assets**: If you notice any missing assets, ensure that all files from the repository were cloned correctly.
